If you're creating a blog post in Google Docs and want to include images, you can add the images to the document just like you normally would. Once you're done with the post, you can download the document as a Word file or a PDF file, depending on your preference.

To include images in your Jekyll site, you can add them to a folder in your Jekyll project directory, such as `_assets/images/`, then reference them in your post using the appropriate Markdown syntax. For example, if you have an image called `my-image.jpg` in the `_assets/images/` directory, you can include it in your post like this:
